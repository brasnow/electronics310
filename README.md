Curriculum for a 4 unit 16 week junior level electronics course called Physics/Mechatronics 310 at California State University Channel Islands, 2025. 

More detailed outline was published in:

The mlxLabGuides are the core of the curriculum, that the students work through, substituting their data for what's in the guide. 
CompressedPDFs of the lab guides are also included in another folder, freezing original data. 
Powerpoints, Quizzes and supplementary problems offer additional materials and assessments. 
Raspberry pi Pico2 and Xiao are where this course was going. Subsequent classes would use these more powerful microcontrollers, but I'm tempted to replace the Arduino (with its quirky serial controller) with the Seeeduino XIAO, which offers better speed, smaller footprint, deep memory, robust serial communication, and low cost in a 5V part.
